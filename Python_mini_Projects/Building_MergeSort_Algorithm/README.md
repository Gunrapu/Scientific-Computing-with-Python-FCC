# Merge Sort Implementation

This script implements the Merge Sort algorithm, a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

## Overview

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself recursively to sort the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

## Features

- Implements the Merge Sort algorithm.
- Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
- Displays the array before and after sorting.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
### Installation
No installation is required. Simply download or clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage

1. Run the script to sort an array of integers:

        python merge_sort.py
