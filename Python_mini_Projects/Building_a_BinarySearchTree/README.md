# Binary Search Tree

This script implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with basic functionalities including insertion, searching, deletion, and inorder traversal.

## Overview

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, the key of the left child is less than the key of the node, and the key of the right child is greater than the key of the node. This script provides methods to insert, search, delete, and traverse the BST.

## Features

- **Insertion:** Add a node with a specific key to the BST.
- **Search:** Find a node with a specific key in the BST.
- **Deletion:** Remove a node with a specific key from the BST.
- **Inorder Traversal:** Traverse the BST in an inorder manner (left, root, right).

## Getting Started

- Python 3.x
### Installation
No installation is required. Simply download or clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage

1. Run the script to create and manipulate a Binary Search Tree:
